# Recycode.online
## Inspiration
Recycling is a critical part of reducing waste. However, in the United States, our recycling information can be difficult to come by. It's not always obvious what can or cannot be recycled and which centers accept what.

## What it does
1. Your business fills out our form and gets a QR code to put on your product.
2. Consumers can scan the QR code to find out how your product can be recycled.
3. Track when, where, and how much your products are recycled by analyzing our QR code scanning data.

## How we built it
MERN stack with google maps API and tailwind, QRCode-React api.

## Challenges we ran into
Tracking users when they recycle the product, and update the stats company wise. 
Gathering the data for recycling centers

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning google maps API and using tailwind, something we have very little experience with.

## What we learned
The whole process of ideation, protoyping, and deployment.
Working on medium sized codebases, where most of the code is written by someone else.

## What's next for Recycode
Adding the reuse element, so that people can post their old products
